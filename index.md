# Jeremy Kansas - ePortfolio 

Hello. Welcome to my portfolio. It is now, and will always be, a work in progress. As is life.

First, as part of my capstone project for my degree, I present to you my code review of three artifacts I chose to enhance:

Next, let me direct you to the first of those artifacts, a simple REST API for performing CRUD operations on a MongoDB database:

*(there are many more projects on my github that I would like to highlight in the future...)*
*(also I will post links to my published Voltage Modular modules once I am able, but I will not be sharing the code for these...)*
